# Comparison of Deep Learning Methods for Power System Protection

> Repository accompanying our PSCC 2026 submission.  
> **Status:** Work in progress ‚Äì code and pretrained models will be released after acceptance.

## Overview

This repository provides the framework, configuration templates, and documentation for a comprehensive benchmark of deep learning architectures applied to **power system protection** tasks.  
The study systematically compares recurrent, convolutional, hybrid, and transformer-based models under identical experimental conditions.

The benchmark covers four core protection tasks:

| Task | Abbreviation | Type | Metric |
|------|---------------|------|---------|
| Fault Detection | FD | Binary classification | F1-score |
| Fault Classification | FC | Multi-class classification | F1-score |
| Fault Line Identification | FLI | Multi-class classification | F1-score |
| Fault Localization | FL | Regression | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) |

All models are trained on high-frequency electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulations of a **90 kV double-line system** with 48 measurement channels and sampling rate of 6.4 kHz.  
Input sequences are windowed to 10‚Äì50 ms segments with 5 ms stride, enabling consistent temporal coverage across tasks.

---

## Key Features

- **Unified training and evaluation pipeline** for FD, FC, FLI, FL  
- **Standardized data preparation** and windowing  
- **Cross-model comparability** through fixed seeds and shared hyperparameters  
- **Reproducibility focus**: all parameters, datasets, and metrics versioned  
- **PyTorch-based implementation** with MLflow tracking (to be published)

## Usage

This repository currently contains only documentation and configuration templates.  
When the paper is accepted, the following will be added:

- Full training and evaluation code  
- Pretrained model checkpoints  
- Figure and table generation scripts  
- Dataset access or generation instructions  

Until then, you may explore:

```bash
configs/train_example.yaml
docs/README.md
```

These files describe expected configuration fields and experiment organization.
